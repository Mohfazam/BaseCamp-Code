# BMI Calculator 💪

A simple **BMI Calculator** built using React to calculate and categorize Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's weight and height. This project is a great way to practice handling state and conditional rendering in React.

## Features 📋
- **User Input**: Input fields to enter weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters).
- **Real-time Calculation**: Automatically calculates BMI whenever weight or height is updated.
- **BMI Category**: Categorizes the calculated BMI into predefined ranges (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, etc.).
- **Responsive Display**: Displays the BMI value up to two decimal points along with the category.

## BMI Categories 🏋️‍♂️
| BMI Range               | Category                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Less than 18.5          | Underweight                 |
| 18.5 - 24.9             | Normal weight               |
| 25.0 - 29.9             | Overweight                  |
| 30.0 - 34.9             | Obesity (Class 1)           |
| 35.0 - 39.9             | Obesity (Class 2)           |
